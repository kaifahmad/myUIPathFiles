The Problem is with the UI Demon App. It is not allowing to enter the decimel in the entry data feed.
I was trying to figure out the problem but i was not able to Troubleshoot it.
Finally i made a test sequence which gave me the currect information about the default application. 



HELLO THERE UI Path Community.
I would like to share a problem i faced while completing the ACME System project in the UI Path REFramework deep dive course.
The UI Demo app attached with the activity does not allows “.” (decimel point) to enter in the entry feilds.
Kindly confirm that anybody else is facing the same issue since its resulting into feeding of inaccurate data.
For eg. : 45.69 is entered as 4569.00
Please look into it.
Thanks,
Kaif Ahmad
